## Key Management and Storage

Decide on a key rotation strategy based on your specific requirements. For example, you may choose to rotate the encryption key on a regular time interval (e.g., every 30 days) or based on specific events, such as a security incident or when a certain threshold of data processed is reached.

Implement proper key management practices to securely store and manage encryption keys. Avoid hard-coding the keys in source code or storing them in plaintext. Consider utilizing secure key management systems or infrastructure, such as hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services provided by cloud providers.
